## 📊 Data Handling

- `Data/imgs/` and `Data_/imgs/` are ignored in git, only `.gitkeep` is preserved.
- `data_unified/` and `ddd/` only commit `.gitkeep` files to keep folder structure.
- Large datasets should be stored locally or on cloud (not in git).
- Example ignored file: `frame.jpg`

## 🛠️ Development Notes

- **AI Models:** Developed in Python (PyTorch / TensorFlow)
- **Backend:** FastAPI serving trained models with REST APIs
- **Frontend:** React dashboard consuming APIs in real-time
- **FPGA/Verilog:** Acceleration & RTL simulations supported in Vivado
